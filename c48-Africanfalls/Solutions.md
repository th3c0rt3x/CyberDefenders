I will try to run walk-through using simple methods not with indepth tools.

Tools Used 
  - 7-Zip 32 bit
  - Notepad++ 32 bit
  - Forensic 7z plugin https://www.tc4shell.com/en/7zip/forensic7z/
  - ShellBags Explorer from Eric Zimmerman's Tools
  - Prefetch Viewer from NirSoft Forensic Tools
  

Just extract the zip file using 7-zip or your preffered zip tools and verify the check sum.

Since I am usng old latop which can't be instaled with FTK or some other disk forensics tool, I prefer to working with alternate tools which works on my Win 7 32 bit machine.

As discussed earlier I will be using Forensic 7z Plug-in for extracting ad1 image (tc4shell has tutorial how to install plugin).
