I will try to run walk-through using simple methods not with indepth tools.

Tools Used 
  - 7-Zip 32 bit
  - Notepad++ 32 bit
  - Forensic 7z plugin https://www.tc4shell.com/en/7zip/forensic7z/

Just extract the zip file using 7-zip or your preffered zip tools and verify the check sum.

Since I am usng very old latop which can't be instaled with FTK or some other forensics tool, I prefer to working to alternate tools which can works on Win 7 32 bit
