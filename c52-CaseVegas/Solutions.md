I will try to run walk-through using simple methods not with indepth tools.

Tools Used 
  - 7-Zip 32 bit
  - Notepad++ 32 bit
  - Couple of OSINT Tools (mostly online based)
  
Topics
  - OSINT
  - Steganography
  - Passive Web Enumeration

Just extract the zip file using 7-zip or your preffered zip tools and verify the check sum of eachfiles.


Learn the basics of gathering information related to websites using open source intelligence research with this fantastic challenge.

Challenge looks like mixed version of online OSINT challenges. I will add couple of track back url's related to tools and old challenges which are added to current challenge.
